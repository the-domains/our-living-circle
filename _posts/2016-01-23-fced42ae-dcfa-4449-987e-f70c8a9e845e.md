The community we live in is an extension of our voice, our will, and our passion. Our community is a reflection of ourselves and those around us. We started Our Living Circle to help bring people together, people who share a joint enthusiasm for their community and helping others, to live their better life. Our hope is that we can create a worldwide network of socially conscious people who want to give back to their community and help shape it into something beautiful.

Princess Circle has always stood for social enterprise and being better. Donating to groups and charities that fit our Giving Guidelines is just one way in which we aim to set an example to other companies. Working with the Central Okanagan Economic Development Commission on Workforce development for the Central Okanagan we strive to make the Valley a better place to live and work. We also have a long standing relationship with USANA that allows us to help better the mind, body and soul with the highest-rated nutritional supplements and health care products. Working with USANA can offer you an enriching secondary source of income. This service is made available to anyone who seeks better financial and physical wellness.

Our Living Circle encourages you to making your being better. Getting out in the world, being active, participating in social enterprises, helping others and believing in human rights and equality are what we stand for. Believing that we, as a people, are more than the sum of our parts; that we are able to exist towards the betterment of each individual we connect with. Because together we become something more. When we work to help one another, aid the communities in which we live, better ourselves in ways that push us to new heights we encompass our existence with love and stability.

Become a part of Our Living Circle so we can grow together.
